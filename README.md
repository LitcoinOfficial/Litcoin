Litcoin
--------------

An open and permissionless cryptocurrency with on-demand confidential transactions.

Why Litcoin?
-----------------

**Private:** Transact anonymously. Transactional data, such as who is involved in transactions and how much value is transferred, is shielded from the world.

**Decentralized:** Litcoinâ€™s peer to peer network supports transactions without a 3rd party which are recorded on the blockchain and verified through Proof of Work.

**Fast:** Pay and get paid faster than Bitcoin. Transact anonymously without sacrificing transaction speeds.


Rest is technical info we will update over time
